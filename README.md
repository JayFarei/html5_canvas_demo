This is a practice project to learn more about HTML5 canvas, draw shapes, add animation and add interactions.

A demo hosted github pages can be found [here](https://jayfarei.github.io/html5_canvas_demo/)

Colour palette picked using [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/cc5803-e2711d-ff9505-ffb627-ffc971)

Next steps:

- [] Implement collision detection logic


Next experiments:
* a popular tool of choice for 3D webGL is [three.js](http://threejs.org/) and a popular choice for 2D webGL is [pixi.js](http://www.pixijs.com/).
* practice on SVG for smaller animation 
* an other good library/abstraction on top of canvas is [anime.js](https://animejs.com) / the cool thing about it, you can animate any DOM object (can work with react)
